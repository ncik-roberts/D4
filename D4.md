### Running D4 on large software 

#### 1. on a single machine
You can run D4 using multi-threads on a single machine. In folder ````edu.tamu.cse.aser.d4````, run the main method in class ````src/edu/tamu/aser/tide/tests/ReproduceBenchmarks.java```` with program argument ````all_short```` and the number of threads you would like to test. For example, ````all_short 8```` or ````avrora_short 8```` (this took a couple of hours on our machine).

#### 2. on a distributed server

To run the distributed D4, update the ````master.conf```` (in ````/edu.tamu.cse.aser.d4/src/master.conf````) and ````worker.conf```` (````/edu.tamu.cse.aser.d4remote/src/worker.conf````) with the local machine and remote server hostnames. For example, ````master.conf```` is shown below. You need to change the ````hostname```` and ````port```` under ````#local pc```` to your local machine's, and change the address under ````#remote server```` to your remote server's name and port.

````
akka {
  actor {
    provider = "akka.cluster.ClusterActorRefProvider"
  }
  remote {
    maximum-payload-bytes = 30000000 bytes
    log-remote-lifecycle-events = off
    netty.tcp {
      #local pc
      hostname = "10.231.215.111"
      port = 4551
    }
  }

  cluster {
    seed-nodes = [
      #local machine
      "akka.tcp://ClusterSystem@10.231.215.111:4551",
      #remote server
      "akka.tcp://ClusterSystem@128.194.136.121:65501"
    ]
````

Then, export ````edu.tamu.cse.aser.d4remote```` as a runnable jar with the main method ````/edu.tamu.cse.aser.d4remote/src/edu/tamu/aser/tide/dist/remote/remote/BackendStart.java```` and the option "Copy required libraries into a sub-folder next to the generated JAR". Transfer the generated jar, sub-folder libraries and ````/edu.tamu.cse.aser.d4remote/data```` to your remote server. Run the jar and wait for the connection between the local machine and the server, and then the evaluation starts.

#### 3. using the Docker Image
To run D4 in the image, please run ````docker run -it aprildocker/d4_ubuntu_java8:firsttry $tool_name $benchmark_name $num_of_threads```` in your terminal. For example, ````docker run -it aprildocker/d4_ubuntu_java8:firsttry d4 fop_short 4```` will run D4 on benchmark ````fop_short```` with 4 threads. ````docker run -it aprildocker/d4_ubuntu_java8:firsttry echo sunflow_short 1```` will run ECHO on benchmark ````sunflow_short```` with 1 threads. Currently, ECHO can only run with 1 threads. 


#### More Technical Details
There are two main technical components in D4: differential pointer analysis and differential happens-before analysis with data race and deadlock detection. We have already released the source code of [our differential pointer analysis](https://github.com/april1989/Incremental_Points_to_Analysis.git), which includes an example of how to use the technique.

Here, we provide an example to illustrate the usage of our differential happens-before analysis with data race and deadlock detection.

After running the whole program pointer analysis, we can build our concurrency bug detection engine ````TIDEEngine```` that includes our static happens-before analysis.
````java 
//initialize the akka system for concurrency bug detection with n number of thread pool workers
ActorSystem akkasys = ActorSystem.create();
ActorRef bughub = akkasys.actorOf(Props.create(BugHub.class, n), "bughub");
//create a new engine for a target program with:
//mainSignature as its main method signature
//cg as its CallGraph, flowgraph as its PropagationGraph, pta as its PointerAnalysis; all are from previous pointer analysis
TIDEEngine engine = new TIDEEngine(mainSignature, cg, flowgraph, pta, bughub);
//start the concurrency bug detection for the first time, and obtain the detected bugs
Set<ITIDEBug> bugs = engine.detectBothBugs(ps);
````
Then, user need to specify four sets: ```delInsts``` to store all the deleted SSAInstructions, ```addInsts``` to store all the added onces, ````changedNodes```` denotes which CGNodes the instructions belong to, and  ````changedModifiers```` denotes which CGNodes have changed their modifiers.
```java
CGNode targetNode = node;
HashSet<SSAInstruction> delInsts = new HashSet<>();
HashSet<SSAInstruction> addInsts = new HashSet<>();
HashSet<CGNode> changedNodes = new HashSet<>();
HashSet<CGNode> changedModifiers= new HashSet<>();
````

```delInsts``` and ```addInsts``` are used for differential pointer analysis, and we can know whether the relative points-to sets have changed (use ````ptachanges```` to indicate). Then, we can run the incremental bug detection on the engine and obtain the new results after the instruction change.
````java
Set<ITIDEBug> bugs = engine.updateEngine(changedNodes, changedModifier, ptachanges, ps);
````
